# Cubic Free and Hermite Splines
Construction of free and Hermite splines passing through assigned points.

## How it works
Arrange the points by clicking on the graph.
The first and last points are beginnings of the first and final vectors necessary to construct a Hermite spline.
TO BUILD SPLINES: press 'p' key.
